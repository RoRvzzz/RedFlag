# RedFlag
RedFlag is a static analysis tool that inspects C++ projects and build systems for risky behaviors, not verdicts. It scans source code and build events for execution, obfuscation, crypto misuse, and hidden payloads, then correlates signals into a transparent risk score humans can reason about.
